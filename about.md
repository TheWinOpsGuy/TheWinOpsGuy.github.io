I'm James Lunardi and I work as a Principal Security Engineer specializing in Microsoft based technologies with a focus on Windows Server and Active Directory. 
I've worked in traditional Enterprise IT Infrastructure roles for the past 12 years but with a recent change of companies, I'm now developing a DevOps mentality and leveraging automation tools to produce Infrastructure as Code. This blog will document my journey in Windows DevOps (WinOps). Opinions are my own.
